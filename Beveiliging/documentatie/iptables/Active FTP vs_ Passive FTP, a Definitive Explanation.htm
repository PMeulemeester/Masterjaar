            <P>One of the most commonly seen questions when dealing with 
            firewalls and other Internet connectivity issues is the difference 
            between active and passive FTP and how best to support either or 
            both of them. Hopefully the following text will help to clear up 
            some of the confusion over how to support FTP in a firewalled 
            environment. </P>
            <P>This may not be <I>the</I> definitive explanation, as the title 
            claims, however, I've heard enough good feedback and seen this 
            document linked in enough places to know that quite a few people 
            have found it to be useful. I am always looking for ways to improve 
            things though, and if you find something that is not quite clear or 
            needs more explanation, please let me know! Recent additions to this 
            document include the examples of both active and passive command 
            line FTP sessions. These session examples should help make things a 
            bit clearer. They also provide a nice picture into what goes on 
            behind the scenes during an FTP session. Now, on to the 
            information... </P><BR>
            <H3><A name=basics>The Basics</A></H3>
            <P>FTP is a TCP based service exclusively. There is no UDP component 
            to FTP. FTP is an unusual service in that it utilizes two ports, a 
            'data' port and a 'command' port (also known as the control port). 
            Traditionally these are port 21 for the command port and port 20 for 
            the data port. The confusion begins however, when we find that 
            depending on the mode, the data port is not always on port 20. 
            </P><BR>
            <H3><A name=active>Active FTP</A></H3>
            <P>In active mode FTP the client connects from a random unprivileged 
            port (N &gt; 1023) to the FTP server's command port, port 21. Then, 
            the client starts listening to port N+1 and sends the FTP command 
            <CODE>PORT N+1</CODE> to the FTP server. The server will then 
            connect back to the client's specified data port from its local data 
            port, which is port 20. </P>
            <P>From the server-side firewall's standpoint, to support active 
            mode FTP the following communication channels need to be opened: 
            <UL>
              <LI>FTP server's port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates 
              connection) 
              <LI>FTP server's port 21 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server responds to 
              client's control port) 
              <LI>FTP server's port 20 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server initiates data 
              connection to client's data port) 
              <LI>FTP server's port 20 from ports &gt; 1023 (Client sends ACKs 
              to server's data port) </LI></UL>
            <P></P>
            <P>When drawn out, the connection appears as follows: 
            <CENTER><IMG 
            src="Active%20FTP%20vs_%20Passive%20FTP,%20a%20Definitive%20Explanation_bestanden/activeftp.gif"> 
            </CENTER>In step 1, the client's command port contacts the server's 
            command port and sends the command <CODE>PORT 1027</CODE>. The 
            server then sends an ACK back to the client's command port in step 
            2. In step 3 the server initiates a connection on its local data 
            port to the data port the client specified earlier. Finally, the 
            client sends an ACK back as shown in step 4. 
            <P></P>
            <P>The main problem with active mode FTP actually falls on the 
            client side. The FTP client doesn't make the actual connection to 
            the data port of the server--it simply tells the server what port it 
            is listening on and the server connects back to the specified port 
            on the client. From the client side firewall this appears to be an 
            outside system initiating a connection to an internal 
            client--something that is usually blocked. </P><BR>
            <H3><A name=actexample>Active FTP Example</A></H3>
            <P>Below is an actual example of an active FTP session. The only 
            things that have been changed are the server names, IP addresses, 
            and user names. In this example an FTP session is initiated from 
            testbox1.slacksite.com (192.168.150.80), a linux box running the 
            standard FTP command line client, to testbox2.slacksite.com 
            (192.168.150.90), a linux box running ProFTPd 1.2.2RC2. The 
            debugging (<CODE>-d</CODE>) flag is used with the FTP client to show 
            what is going on behind the scenes. Everything in <FONT 
            color=red>red</FONT> is the debugging output which shows the actual 
            FTP commands being sent to the server and the responses generated 
            from those commands. Normal server output is shown in black, and 
            user input is in <STRONG>bold</STRONG>. </P>
            <P>There are a few interesting things to consider about this dialog. 
            Notice that when the <CODE>PORT</CODE> command is issued, it 
            specifies a port on the <I>client</I> (192.168.150.80) system, 
            rather than the server. We will see the opposite behavior when we 
            use passive FTP. While we are on the subject, a quick note about the 
            format of the <CODE>PORT</CODE> command. As you can see in the 
            example below it is formatted as a series of six numbers separated 
            by commas. The first four octets are the IP address while the last 
            two octets comprise the port that will be used for the data 
            connection. To find the actual port multiply the fifth octet by 256 
            and then add the sixth octet to the total. Thus in the example below 
            the port number is ( (14*256) + 178), or 3762. A quick check with 
            <CODE>netstat</CODE> should confirm this information. </P><PRE>testbox1: {/home/p-t/slacker/public_html} % <STRONG>ftp -d testbox2</STRONG>

            <P>In order to resolve the issue of the server initiating the 
            connection to the client a different method for FTP connections was 
            developed. This was known as passive mode, or <CODE>PASV</CODE>, 
            after the command used by the client to tell the server it is in 
            passive mode. </P>
            <P>In passive mode FTP the client initiates both connections to the 
            server, solving the problem of firewalls filtering the incoming data 
            port connection to the client from the server. When opening an FTP 
            connection, the client opens two random unprivileged ports locally 
            (N &gt; 1023 and N+1). The first port contacts the server on port 
            21, but instead of then issuing a <CODE>PORT</CODE> command and 
            allowing the server to connect back to its data port, the client 
            will issue the <CODE>PASV</CODE> command. The result of this is that 
            the server then opens a random unprivileged port (P &gt; 1023) and 
            sends the <CODE>PORT P</CODE> command back to the client. The client 
            then initiates the connection from port N+1 to port P on the server 
            to transfer data. </P>
            <P>From the server-side firewall's standpoint, to support passive 
            mode FTP the following communication channels need to be opened: 
            <UL>
              <LI>FTP server's port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates 
              connection) 
              <LI>FTP server's port 21 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server responds to 
              client's control port) 
              <LI>FTP server's ports &gt; 1023 from anywhere (Client initiates 
              data connection to random port specified by server) 
              <LI>FTP server's ports &gt; 1023 to remote ports &gt; 1023 (Server 
              sends ACKs (and data) to client's data port) </LI></UL>
            <P></P>
            <P>When drawn, a passive mode FTP connection looks like this: 
            <CENTER><IMG 
            src="Active%20FTP%20vs_%20Passive%20FTP,%20a%20Definitive%20Explanation_bestanden/passiveftp.gif"> 
            </CENTER>In step 1, the client contacts the server on the command 
            port and issues the <CODE>PASV</CODE> command. The server then 
            replies in step 2 with <CODE>PORT 2024</CODE>, telling the client 
            which port it is listening to for the data connection. In step 3 the 
            client then initiates the data connection from its data port to the 
            specified server data port. Finally, the server sends back an ACK in 
            step 4 to the client's data port. 
            <P></P>
            <P>While passive mode FTP solves many of the problems from the 
            client side, it opens up a whole range of problems on the server 
            side. The biggest issue is the need to allow any remote connection 
            to high numbered ports on the server. Fortunately, many FTP daemons, 
            including the popular WU-FTPD allow the administrator to specify a 
            range of ports which the FTP server will use. See <A

            for more information. </P>
            <P>The second issue involves supporting and troubleshooting clients 
            which do (or do not) support passive mode. As an example, the 
            command line FTP utility provided with Solaris does not support 
            passive mode, necessitating a third-party FTP client, such as ncftp. 
            </P>
            <P>With the massive popularity of the World Wide Web, many people 
            prefer to use their web browser as an FTP client. Most browsers only 
            support passive mode when accessing ftp:// URLs. This can either be 
            good or bad depending on what the servers and firewalls are 
            configured to support. </P><BR>
            <H3><A name=pasvexample>Passive FTP Example</A></H3>
            <P>Below is an actual example of a passive FTP session. The only 
            things that have been changed are the server names, IP addresses, 
            and user names. In this example an FTP session is initiated from 
            testbox1.slacksite.com (192.168.150.80), a linux box running the 
            standard FTP command line client, to testbox2.slacksite.com 
            (192.168.150.90), a linux box running ProFTPd 1.2.2RC2. The 
            debugging (<CODE>-d</CODE>) flag is used with the FTP client to show 
            what is going on behind the scenes. Everything in <FONT 
            color=red>red</FONT> is the debugging output which shows the actual 
            FTP commands being sent to the server and the responses generated 
            from those commands. Normal server output is shown in black, and 
            user input is in <STRONG>bold</STRONG>. </P>
            <P>Notice the difference in the <CODE>PORT</CODE> command in this 
            example as opposed to the active FTP example. Here, we see a port 
            being opened on the <I>server</I> (192.168.150.90) system, rather 
            than the client. See the discussion about the format of the 
            <CODE>PORT</CODE> command above, in the <A 
            href="http://slacksite.com/other/actexample">Active FTP Example 
            section</A>. </P><PRE>testbox1: {/home/p-t/slacker/public_html} % <STRONG>ftp -d testbox2</STRONG>

            <P>A reader, Maarten Sjouw, pointed out that active FTP will not 
            function when used in conjunction with a client-side NAT (Network 
            Address Translation) device which is not smart enough to alter the 
            IP address info in FTP packets. </P><BR>
            <H3><A name=summary>Summary</A></H3>
            <P>The following chart should help admins remember how each FTP mode 
            works: <PRE> Active FTP :
     command : client &gt;1023 -&gt; server 21
     data    : client &gt;1023 &lt;- server 20

 Passive FTP :
     command : client &gt;1023 -&gt; server 21
     data    : client &gt;1023 -&gt; server &gt;1023
</PRE>
            <P></P>
            <P>A quick summary of the pros and cons of active vs. passive FTP is 
            also in order: </P>
            <P>Active FTP is beneficial to the FTP server admin, but detrimental 
            to the client side admin. The FTP server attempts to make 
            connections to random high ports on the client, which would almost 
            certainly be blocked by a firewall on the client side. Passive FTP 
            is beneficial to the client, but detrimental to the FTP server 
            admin. The client will make both connections to the server, but one 
            of them will be to a random high port, which would almost certainly 
            be blocked by a firewall on the server side. </P>
            <P>Luckily, there is somewhat of a compromise. Since admins running 
            FTP servers will need to make their servers accessible to the 
            greatest number of clients, they will almost certainly need to 
            support passive FTP. The exposure of high level ports on the server 
            can be minimized by specifying a limited port range for the FTP 
            server to use. Thus, everything except for this range of ports can 
            be firewalled on the server side. While this doesn't eliminate all 
            risk to the server, it decreases it tremendously. See <A 
            href="http://slacksite.com/other/ftp-appendix1.html">Appendix 1</A> 
            for more information. <BR>
            <H3><A name=references>References</A></H3>
            <P>An excellent reference on how various internet protocols work and 
            the issues involved in firewalling them can be found in the O'Reilly 
            and Associates book, <I>Building Internet Firewalls, 2nd Ed</I>, by 
            Brent Chapman and Elizabeth Zwicky. </P>
            <P>Finally, the definitive reference on FTP would be RFC 959, which 
            sets forth the official specifications of the FTP protocol. RFCs can 
            be downloaded from numerous locations, including <A 
            href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html</A>.
